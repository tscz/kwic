# Key word in Context (KWIC) index system
A little web-app for the KWIC Index Production System example 1 from the Paper [On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules](https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf) from 1972.

There is a statement in this paper which struck me: 

> This is a small system. Except under extreme circumstances (huge data base, no supporting software), such a system could be produced by a good programmer in a week or two.

This web app is an experiment if this statement still is valid and how the complexity shifted within modern technology 50 years later. Also I want to check how I would modularize such a system and compare it with the papers statements.
